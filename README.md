## About ✨

This repository includes a wide range of Python topics, including:

- Basic syntax 📝
- Data types (strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.) 📊
- Control flow (loops, conditionals) 🔄
- Functions and modules 🔧
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) 🏗️
- File handling 📂
- Error handling 🚨
- Algorithms and data structures 📈
- And much more! 🎯

Each exercise is designed to build my programming knowledge step by step, and some include simple projects or challenges. 💻

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Python**: All code is written in Python 3.x 🐍.
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Some exercises may utilize standard Python libraries such as `os`, `sys`, `math`, `random`, `time`, etc. 📦
